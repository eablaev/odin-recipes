        <p>Grilling carrots in foil not only brings out their natural sweetness, it's a no-mess way to cook your side dish without heating up the kitchen. The caramelized pieces are the best part!</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>aluminum foil</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds carrots, peeled and cut 1/2 inch thick diagonally</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.</li>
            <li>Place carrots on a large sheet of foil, approximately 18 inches long. Sprinkle with salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper, then drizzle evenly with olive oil. Toss to coat. Fold edges together and securely close to form a foil packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside.</li>
            <li>Grill packet for 15 minutes, shaking packet once. Turn packet over and continue grilling until carrots are soft and lightly charred, about 10 minutes more. Carefully open packet by cutting along top with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape.</li>
            
        </ol>
