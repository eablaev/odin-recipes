        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <img src="../images/lasagna.webp" alt="Lasagna">
        <p>This classic Italian dish from Sicily is often simply referred to as 'Parmigiana' by the Sicilian locals. </p>
        <p>The richness and depth of flavor that you get from this authentic version is well worth the extra effort. Serve eggplant Parmigiana with nothing more than crusty bread and a green salad.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>6 eggplants, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups crushed tomatoes in puree</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh basil, divided</li>
            <li>18 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, drained and sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat about 1 inch extra-virgin olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Pat eggplant slices dry with a paper towel and fry eggplant in batches in the hot oil until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer eggplant to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon; season with salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place a layer of fried eggplant in the baking dish and cover with a layer of tomato sauce. Top with a layer of mozzarella cheese, oregano, Parmesan cheese, and chopped basil leaves, in that order. Continue layering in the same order with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses are melted, about 40 minutes. Let stand a few minutes before slicing.</li>
           
        </ol>
